# Zitec Magento Coding Assessment

Welcome to Zitec's Magento Coding Assessment!

### Working on the project

* As you might have noticed, this test is delivered via Gitpod, an online IDE derived from Visual Studio Code. If you
  haven't used Visual Studio Code before, allow yourself a few minutes to familiarize with the interface.
* There are no setup steps, you can start coding as soon as the online IDE loads. Just to be safe, please check that
  the preview loads by following the instructions below.
* When you're done or simply want to stop working on the project, just close the Gitpod browser window and send a short
  email to your Zitec guide (usually someone from HR), letting them know they can close the workspace.
